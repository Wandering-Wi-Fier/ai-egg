## 🧠 Reese’s AI Core System

Reese supports **up to 10 interchangeable AI cores**, using `.gguf` models through `llama-cpp-python`.

Each core is mapped in `models.json` like this:

```json
{
  "oracle": "https://huggingface.co/billybones206/reese-core-models/resolve/main/yi-1.5-9b.Q4_K_M.gguf",
  "mirror": "https://huggingface.co/billybones206/reese-core-models/resolve/main/neuralhermes-2.5.Q4_K_M.gguf"
}
```

Use `llama-cpp-python` to load each model dynamically.
